                <h1>Bridging the Divide: The Eveleigh Bridge Project</h1>
                <p>For over a century, the railway corridor has served as the industrial heart of Sydney. Today, it stands as a physical barrier keeping neighbours apart. We are campaigning to finally build the bridge that will reunite across Eveleigh.</p>

        <section id="great-divide" class="section-content">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>The Barrier</h2>
                <p>While Eveleigh has transformed from a global steam-train powerhouse into a modern hub of innovation and housing, it remains split in two.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Divide:</strong> The rail lines create a massive "dead zone" between Darlington/Newtown and Alexandria/Erskineville.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Impact:</strong> Residents and workers face long detours to access jobs, schools, and transport, stifling the flow of a now-dense inner-city suburb.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>A Legacy of Innovation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>South Eveleigh:</strong> Now home to 20,000 workers at the Commonwealth Bank, CSIRO, Channel 7, and refurbished heritage buildings.</li>
                    <li><strong>North Eveleigh:</strong> A cultural destination anchored by Carriageworks, drawing 400,000 visitors annually, with significant new social and affordable housing on the way.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Broken Promise</h3>
                <p>In 2004, the NSW Government promised a bridge to connect these precincts. Two decades later, the community is still waiting. As the area becomes more densely populated, the need to reinstate this connection has never been more urgent.</p>

                <h3>The Eveleigh Bridge Alliance</h3>
                <p>In 2025, local resident groups (Alexandria Residents Action Group, Friends of Erskineville, and REDWatch) joined forces to form the Eveleigh Bridge Alliance. We believe heritage is about more than just old buildings—it’s about the people and the connections between them. A bridge will not only honor the site’s history of movement but also unlock the future of our neighborhood.</p>

                <p>The government’s renewal plans reserve space for a bridge but provide no plan to build it. The Eveleigh Bridge Alliance is fighting to turn that "reserved space" into a reality. We are advocating for a safe, modern pedestrian and cycle link that honors the 2004 promise.</p>

                <h2>Experience the Divide</h2>
                <p>To truly understand the need for the bridge, we encourage you to walk the perimeter of the rail yards. Start at Carriageworks (North) and try to reach The Foundry (South) on foot via Redfern, Macdonaldtown, and Erskineville railway crossings. You will quickly see why a direct connection is essential for our community.</p>

                    <h3>Why do we need a bridge now?</h3>
                    <p>The area has shifted from a closed industrial site to a dense residential and commercial suburb. With 20,000 workers on the South side and thousands of new residents moving in, detours are no longer sustainable.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Wasn’t this bridge already planned?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. In 2004, the NSW Premier promised a bridge, but it was never built.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will the bridge impact heritage buildings?</h3>
                    <p>The design respects NSW Heritage Register listings and enhances access to heritage sites.</p>
