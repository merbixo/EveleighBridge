<section class="content">

<h3>Why is a bridge needed now?</h3>
<p>Residential density and employment numbers have increased significantly. Internal connectivity has not been restored since rail consolidation.</p>

<h3>Was a bridge previously proposed?</h3>
<p>Yes. Planning references date back to 2004. Current documents continue to reserve space for a crossing.</p>

<h3>Is there space allocated?</h3>
<p>Yes. Renewal plans identify landing locations on both sides of the corridor.</p>

<h3>Will heritage be affected?</h3>
<p>Any proposal would require compliance with NSW Heritage Register requirements and sensitive design integration.</p>

<h3>Is construction feasible?</h3>
<p>Pedestrian bridges over active rail lines are standard infrastructure projects when appropriate safety and engineering controls are applied.</p>

<h3>Who comprises the Alliance?</h3>
<p>A coalition of local community organisations advocating for delivery of the reserved link.</p>
